# Introduction
 TODO: 
  - give a traditional story of bias-variance trade off
  - Relate ideas to Occam's Razzor
  - Mention possible issues, e.g. double descent 


## Bias-Variance decomposition in specific setting
## Human Heuristics and Occam's Razzor


# Fallacy in relationship between complexity and variance
TODO: 
  - Number of parameter is not a good measure of complexity. 
  - Examples of wrong complexity measures. 


# Correct measure of complexity? 
TODO: 
  - Introduce singular learning theory
  - RLCT as complexity measures? 


# Discussion from first principles 
TODO: 
  - What is the correct formulation? 
  - Generalisation error. 
  - The study of statistcial learning theory.
